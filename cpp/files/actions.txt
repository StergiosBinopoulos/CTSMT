# Comments are achieved with '#' as the first character
# The supported actions are duration, passenger, spawn, remove, open_doors,
#
# Actions are written as such -> 'STEP'|'ACTION':'ARGUMENTS'
#   -> 'STEP' (int) being the step in which the action will take place 
#   -> 'ACTION' (str) being the action name (one of {duration, passenger, spawn, remove, open_doors})
#   -> 'ARGUMENTS' being the arguments (double values first, vectors of double afterwards)
#
# duration: sets the simulation duration steps
#           the 'STEP' is ignored by the parser
#           but should be included in order to avoid errors
#           it's recommended to be set to zero
#           example -> 0|duration:3000 (duration of 3000 steps)
#
# passenger: creates a passenger
#            arguments -> x, y, dx, dy, phase, inf
#            with x, y: being location coordinates (double)
#                 dx, dy: being destination coordinates (double)
#                 phase: the current phase of the passenger (int) (set to -1 for driver, 0 for auto)
#                 inf: 1 if the passenger is a source of infection, 0 otherwise (int)
#            example -> 0|passenger:0.5,0.3,5.0,2.0,1,1 
#
# spawn: spawns passengers outside the vehicle and opens the doors for them to enter
#            arguments -> n_in, n_source, doors_prob
#            with n_in: number of passengers entering (int)
#                 n_source: number of which transfer the infection (must be <=n_in)(int)
#                 doors_prob: the distribution of passengers to the doors (must have length equal to doors) (must add up to 1) (vector of double)
#            example -> 12|spawn:10,2,{0.9, 0.1} 
#               (spawns 10 passengers of which 2 transmit the infection at step 12)
#               (most of them are spawned under the first of the two doors)
#
# remove: removes passengers from the environment (should be coupled with 'open_doors' some steps later (recommended 50))
#            arguments -> n
#            with n: number of passengers exiting (int)
#            example -> 20|remove:10 (removes 10 passengers at step 12)
#
# open_doors: open_doors
#            example -> 20|open_doors: (opens doors at step 20)
#
# Full example bellow (must be run on a three door environment):

0|duration:1500
#0|passenger:17,2.1,17,2.1,-1,0
0|spawn:65,5,{0.3, 0.4, 0.3}
400|spawn:20,1,{0.3, 0.4, 0.3}
